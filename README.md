# 90 Days Backend Challenge 🚀

This repository documents my **90-day backend engineering challenge** using **Java & Spring Boot**.  
The goal is to build a strong backend foundation by working on real-world APIs and following industry-level practices — **learning by building, in public**.

---

## 🎯 Goal
To become a confident backend developer by:
- Building production-style REST APIs
- Following clean architecture (Controller → Service → Repository)
- Writing scalable and maintainable backend code
- Handling errors, validations, and edge cases properly
- Understanding real-world backend flows
- Sharing daily learning and progress publicly

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Java  
- Spring Boot  
- Spring Data JPA  
- MySQL  
- Maven  
- Git & GitHub  
- Postman  

---

## 📅 Progress Tracker

### ✅ Day 1 – Foundation Setup
- Spring Boot project initialization
- Clean package structure
- Basic controller setup
- Database connection verified

---

### ✅ Day 2 – Database & Create API
- User entity creation
- Repository, service, and controller layers
- POST API implementation
- Postman testing
- Handled duplicate email constraint

---

### ✅ Day 3 – Clean APIs & Validation
- DTO implementation
- Request validation
- Global exception handling
- Clean and secure API responses

---

### ✅ Day 4 – Read APIs
- GET all users API
- GET user by ID API
- Custom 404 handling for invalid IDs
- Improved service-layer logic
- Complete Postman testing

---

### ✅ Day 5 – Update & Delete APIs (CRUD Complete)
- PUT API to update user details
- DELETE API to remove users
- Proper validation before update/delete
- Clean 404 handling for missing resources
- Full CRUD flow completed
- Real-world Git merge conflict handling experience

---

### ✅ Day 6 – Pagination, Sorting & Search APIs
- Implemented pagination using `Pageable`
- Sorting support using dynamic fields
- Search users by name (case-insensitive)
- Fetch user details by email
- Proper handling of invalid email cases
- Removed Lombok dependency and fixed constructor issues
- Deep Postman testing for all scenarios
- Improved real-world backend API usability

---

### ✅ Day 7 – Week 1 Review & Code Polish
- Full API retesting using Postman
- Code cleanup and formatting
- Verified service-layer logic and edge cases
- Updated project documentation (README)
- Week 1 backend foundation completed successfully

---

## 📌 Current Status
**Week 1 completed successfully** ✅  

✔ Full CRUD APIs implemented  
✔ Pagination, sorting & search added  
✔ Clean layered architecture followed  
✔ Proper exception handling & validations  
✔ All APIs tested with Postman  
✔ Real-world backend workflow understood  

---

## 🚀 Next Phase (Week 2 Preview)
- Spring Security basics
- JWT authentication
- Role-based access control
- Securing APIs like real production systems
