# 90 Days Backend Challenge 🚀

This repository documents my **90-day backend engineering challenge** using **Java & Spring Boot**.  
The goal is to build a strong backend foundation by working on real-world APIs and following industry-level practices.

---

## 🎯 Goal
To become a confident backend developer by:
- Building production-style REST APIs
- Following clean architecture (Controller → Service → Repository)
- Handling errors and edge cases properly
- Writing scalable and maintainable backend code
- Learning and sharing progress publicly

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- MySQL
- Maven
- Git & GitHub
- Postman

---

## 📅 Progress Tracker

### ✅ Day 1 – Foundation Setup
- Spring Boot project initialization
- Clean package structure
- Basic controller setup
- Database connection verified

---

### ✅ Day 2 – Database & Create API
- User entity creation
- Repository, service, and controller layers
- POST API implementation
- Postman testing
- Handled duplicate email constraint

---

### ✅ Day 3 – Clean APIs & Validation
- DTO implementation
- Request validation
- Global exception handling
- Clean and secure API responses

---

### ✅ Day 4 – Read APIs
- GET all users API
- GET user by ID API
- Custom 404 handling for invalid IDs
- Improved service-layer logic

---

### ✅ Day 5 – Update & Delete APIs (CRUD Complete)
- PUT API to update user details
- DELETE API to remove users
- Proper validation before update/delete
- Clean 404 handling for missing resources
- Full CRUD flow completed
- Real-world Git merge conflict handling

---

### ✅ Day 6 – Pagination, Sorting & Search APIs
- Implemented pagination using `Pageable`
- Sorting support using dynamic fields
- Search users by name (case-insensitive)
- Fetch user details by email
- Proper handling of invalid email cases
- Removed Lombok dependency and fixed constructor issues
- Deep Postman testing for all scenarios
- Improved real-world backend API usability

---

## 📌 Current Status
**Day 6 completed successfully** ✅  

✔ Full CRUD APIs  
✔ Pagination, sorting & search implemented  
✔ Clean architecture followed  
✔ Proper exception handling  
✔ All APIs tested using Postman
